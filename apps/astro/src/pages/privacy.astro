        At <strong>{Env.SITE_NAME}</strong>, we value the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting
        their personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the practices we follow regarding
        the collection, use, storage, and deletion of data on our one-time email website.
      </p>

  <h2 id="collection-of-information">1. Collection of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We only collect and store an email name for the duration of the session. This information
    is necessary to facilitate the functioning of our one-time email service.
  </p>

  <h2 id="storage-of-emails">2. Storage of Emails</h2>
  <p>
    All emails sent and received through our one-time email service are temporarily stored in
    Cloudflare data centers. This storage is essential for the proper delivery and retrieval
    of emails during the active session.
  </p>

  <h2 id="deletion-of-emails">3. Deletion of Emails</h2>
  <p>
    Once an email expires, we ensure the complete deletion of the email from our system. This
    means that all associated data, including the email content and any related information,
    will be permanently removed from our servers.
  </p>

  <h2 id="data-security">4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take appropriate measures to protect the personal information and emails stored on our
    website. However, it is important to note that no method of data transmission or storage
    is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect user
    data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2 id="third-party-services">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party services, such as Cloudflare, to assist in the operation and
    maintenance of our website. These third-party services may have access to certain user
    data, including email names and content, solely for the purpose of providing their
    services. We ensure that any third-party services we use are reputable and have
    appropriate data protection measures in place.
  </p>

  <h2 id="information-sharing">6. Information Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal information or email content to third
    parties, except as required by law or as necessary to protect our rights, property, or
    safety.
  </p>

  <h2 id="cookies">7. Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    We may use cookies to enhance the user experience on our website. These cookies may
    collect non-personal information and are used solely for website analytics and
    functionality purposes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="childrens-privacy">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our website is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not
    knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we may have
    inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us
    immediately, and we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2 id="changes-to-the-privacy-policy">9. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes made
    will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy on our website. It
    is advisable to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
  </p>

  <h2 id="contact-us">10. Contact Us</h2>
