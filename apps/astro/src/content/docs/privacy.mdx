## Overview

We value the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting their personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the practices we follow regarding the collection, use, storage, and deletion of data on our temporary email website.

## 1. Collection of Information

We only collect and store an email name for the duration of the session. This information
is necessary to facilitate the functioning of our one-time email service.

## 2. Storage of Emails

All emails sent and received through our one-time email service are temporarily stored in
Cloudflare data centers. This storage is essential for the proper delivery and retrieval
of emails during the active session.

## 3. Deletion of Emails

Once an email expires, we ensure the complete deletion of the email from our system. This
means that all associated data, including the email content and any related information,
will be permanently removed from our servers.

## 4. Data Security

We take appropriate measures to protect the personal information and emails stored on our
website. However, it is important to note that no method of data transmission or storage
is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect user
data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services, such as Cloudflare, to assist in the operation and
maintenance of our website. These third-party services may have access to certain user
data, including email names and content, solely for the purpose of providing their
services. We ensure that any third-party services we use are reputable and have
appropriate data protection measures in place.

## 6. Information Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal information or email content to third
parties, except as required by law or as necessary to protect our rights, property, or
safety.

## 7. Cookies

We may use cookies to enhance the user experience on our website. These cookies may
collect non-personal information and are used solely for website analytics and
functionality purposes.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our website is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we may have
inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us
immediately, and we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.

## 9. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes made
will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy on our website. It
is advisable to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
